## Background and Objective:

Background: The New York Times Bestseller List is considered the most significant list of best-selling books in the United States. The rankings reflect sales figures that have been confidentially reported by sellers.Each week, thousands of different outlets report their actual sales of hundreds of thousands of individual titles. However, since the list is very comprehensive, it makes sense for readers to be able to sort books by their Favorite Authors and other criteria.

Objective: The goal of this program is to provide various search and filter options for a data set. The dataset refers to the New York Times bestseller list published since 1942 and filters by the 1# books on the list. The user should be enabled by the program to search the book list by various filters, such as author, year or title.

## Set-up
### Required Programs and files:
1. Python3: The program was written with Python 3, so we can guarantee proper functionality only with the current version. Python is open source and thus available free of charge on the Internet and can be downloaded via the following link.

2. Datafile: The data used for the search functions is located in the bestseller2.txt file, which is provided above. This data set is a basic requirement for the use of the program, since all functions refer to it.

3. Pandas: Pandas is one of the most widely used python libraries in data science. It provides high-performance, easy to use structures and data analysis tools. Pandas makes it simple to do many of the time consuming, repetitive tasks associated with working with data. This program needs the package to sort out the data in the file and you can find a quick guide to download Pandas here.

4. Regex: A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern. This is required to allow the search functions to work. You can download the package here.

## Program Description 
After all the necessary programs have been installed, there are several ways to start the search engine. The easiest way is to start Python directly and copy the code linked above into the console. After that, the user is asked for a file, which is again the bestseller2.txt. This can be downloaded directly from github and saved on your own computer. After that, only the path in the program must be linked and the preparations are complete.
